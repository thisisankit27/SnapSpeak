Please refrain from publicly disclosing any security vulnerabilities until we have had an opportunity to investigate and provide a fix. We will work diligently to address the issue and keep you informed of our progress.

## Security Updates

We are committed to promptly addressing and disclosing any security vulnerabilities that may arise within SnapSpeak. When a security issue is reported and confirmed, we will take the following steps:

1. Investigate the reported vulnerability to verify its validity and scope.
2. Develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.
3. Release a security update containing the fix, along with any necessary instructions or mitigations for users.
4. Notify users of the security update via our official communication channels, including our website, blog, and social media.

We prioritize the security of our users and strive to maintain a transparent and responsive approach to handling security vulnerabilities.
